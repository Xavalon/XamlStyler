# XAML Styler Console

The power of XAML Styler wrapped up in a small executable that can be integrated into build scripts, git commit templates, and more.

XAML Styler is a visual studio extension that formats XAML source code based on a set of styling rules. This tool can help you/your team maintain a better XAML coding style as well as a much better XAML readability.

This package is built on top of the same styling engine that powers the Visual Studio plugin, and can be configured by specifying an external configuration.
